# Observations
- [Scatter Plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) and [Line Plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) shows us the same information as the data here is not continuous
- The state-wise subsidy disbursed to women under PMEGP scheme in year 2019-20 is shown in all the plots
- The [Box Plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html) shows us the distribution of data and we can see as the size of rectangle is small with the dots very high. This shows that the data is closely packed with some values being very high.
